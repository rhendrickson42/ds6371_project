1) Fix violations in data, scatter plots of variables
a) colineairty, correlation
b) outliers, influence
c) need transformations?

2) Run model with everything
a) Check VIF - outliers?  redundant variables?
b) correlations?
c) Dont delete vars until have figured out and have dataset that meets assumptions
d) fit statistics
e) residual plots - outliers, leverage (find, delete - if after research shows should be removed (from diff pop?)

3) After Delete - re-run model
a) R^2
b) VIF
c) Leverage
d) QQPLOT
e) Outliers again
f) Repeat?

4) Variable Selection + Cross Validation
